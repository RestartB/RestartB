## ðŸ‘‹, I'm Restart! (he/him)
Hi, I'm Restart! I'm a 17 year old from the UK. I love computing, programming and networking! My main projects are the [Titanium Discord Bot](https://github.com/RestartB/Titanium), an open source and multipurpose Discord bot written in discord.py, and [DeviceGalaxy](https://github.com/RestartB/DeviceGalaxy), a website that lets you track and share your device collection.
